Overview
The US Department of Health and Human Services provides federal-level collection and publishing of COVID-19 testing and patient outcome data. To better understand the current state of COVID-19 testing in the US, weâ€™d like you to create a Python project and documentation for the following metrics:

The total number of PCR tests performed as of yesterday in the United States.
The 7-day rolling average number of new cases per day for the last 30 days.
The 10 states with the highest test positivity rate (positive tests / tests performed) for tests performed in the last 30 days.
For each of the above, please provide:

The Python code that yields the desired metric
A report/output that communicates the metric results
A brief description of the metric presented and any insights you've gleaned from this metric. Be sure to include any caveats and context that should be communicated to stakeholders to aid in their interpretation.
